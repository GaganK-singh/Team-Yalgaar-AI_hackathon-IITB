  **Temperature Alert Agent**

▪️ Project Description:-

  The project aims to create a temperature controller with the following main features using Fetch.ai's uAgent library:
  
  a) **Fabric actual temperature page**: Agent that connects to the free weather API to get the temperature. Temperature data for a specific location. This allows users to receive up-to-date weather information.
  
  b) **User Preferences**: Users can adjust their temperature by setting the temperature (minimum and maximum) and displaying the location temperature. interest. This change allows users to receive warm alerts     tailored to their specific needs and preferences.
  
  c) **Temperature Deviation Alert**: The agent monitors the temperature at the location selected by the user. It causes an alert or warning when the current temperature falls below the user's minimum or exceeds   the maximum threshold. This alert system notifies users of temperature changes, allowing them to take appropriate or preventative measures.
  
  In summary, this project creates a temperature alert proxy that connects to the weather API, allowing users to set the temperature parameters of their choice and generate timely alerts when temperature         
  conditions deviate from certain areas. The agent is designed to keep users aware of the temperature, provide important information in a timely manner, and provide reports for various purposes such as weather   
  monitoring, management of the environment, or security.
